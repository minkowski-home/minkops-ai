# Infrastructure

This folder will hold Terraform, Docker Compose, Kubernetes overlays, and GitHub automation that deploys the pluseleven AI suite and the corporate website. Infrastructure manifests should reference the same shared policies described elsewhere in the repo and expose environment-specific overlays (dev/stage/prod) similar to the `env/` directory from Minkowski’s layout.
