# Database Connection
# ADMIN_DB_URL — superuser connection used only by `seed-db` for DDL operations
#                (DROP/CREATE tables). Typically the OS user or a dedicated admin role.
#                Falls back to DATABASE_URL if unset (single-URL local dev setups).
# DATABASE_URL — least-privilege app user connection used by the runtime for all DML.
#                This user should only have SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
