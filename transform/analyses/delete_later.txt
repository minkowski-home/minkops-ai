PURPOSE:
This folder is for "Analyses" (Ad-hoc queries).
These are SQL files that are compiled by dbt but NOT run against the database to create tables/views.
They are useful for saving analytical queries that you want to version control but don't need to materialize.

HOW TO START:
1. Create a file here (e.g., `monthly_revenue_report.sql`).
2. Write a SELECT statement. You can use Jinja and refs like `{{ ref('my_model') }}`.
3. Run `dbt compile`.
4. Go to `target/compiled/...` to see the executable SQL.
