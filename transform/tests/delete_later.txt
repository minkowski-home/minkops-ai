PURPOSE:
This folder is for "Singular Tests".
Most tests (not null, unique) are defined in YAML files in the `models/` directory (Generic Tests).
This folder is for specific, complex SQL queries that assert data quality.
If the query returns > 0 rows, the test FAILS.

HOW TO START:
1. Create a file here (e.g., `assert_total_payment_is_positive.sql`).
2. Write: `SELECT * FROM {{ ref('orders') }} WHERE amount < 0`.
3. Run `dbt test`.
4. If any rows are returned (i.e., negative payments exist), dbt will flag it as a failure.
