PURPOSE:
This folder is for "Models" (The Core Logic).
Every .sql file in this directory represents a Table or View in your data warehouse.
dbt takes these SELECT statements and wraps them in `CREATE VIEW/TABLE AS ...`.

HOW TO START:
1. Create subfolders for organization: `staging` (raw cleanup) and `marts` (business logic).
2. Create a file (e.g., `staging/stg_users.sql`).
3. Write a SELECT statement.
4. Run `dbt run`.
5. Check your database; the table `stg_users` will exist.
