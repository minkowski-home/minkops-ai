PURPOSE:
This folder is for "Macros".
Macros are reusable snippets of SQL (written in Jinja) that work like functions.
If you find yourself copy-pasting the same WHERE clause or CASE statement, turn it into a macro.

HOW TO START:
1. Create a file here (e.g., `cents_to_dollars.sql`).
2. Define a macro block:
   {% macro cents_to_dollars(column_name) %}
       ({{ column_name }} / 100)::numeric(16, 2)
   {% endmacro %}
3. Use it in your models: `{{ cents_to_dollars('amount_in_cents') }}`.
