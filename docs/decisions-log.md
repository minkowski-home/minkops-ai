# Decision Logs

## 03-02-2026
- Create `decision-logs.md`

Store product briefs (on new launches), onboarding playbooks, system design decisions, problems found, how were they fixed, architecture notes, and governance policies here. When new cross-cutting decisions are made — for example, team conventions for knowledge graphs, audit trails, or policy enforcement, or any major improvement/trade-off — capture them in `docs/` so every module (apps, services, infra) can reference the same playbook, just like the `docs/` directory in the Minkowski monorepo. There isn't a strict schema to `decision-log.md` files (except current date), they can include anything that can be used as a learning material for junior engineers to understand senior practices.
