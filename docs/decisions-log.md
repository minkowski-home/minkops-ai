# Shared Documentation

Store product briefs, onboarding playbooks, architecture notes, and governance policies here. When new cross-cutting decisions are made — for example, team conventions for knowledge graphs, audit trails, or policy enforcement — capture them in `docs/` so every module (apps, services, infra) can reference the same playbook, just like the `docs/` directory in the Minkowski monorepo.
